Hello!I am a graduate student specializing in Geographic Information Systems Technology (GIST) with a deep passion for environmental conservation and social relevance. My focus is on using spatial analysis to solve complex problems, particularly in projects that help people access essential resources for a better quality of life. I love challenging myself, whether it’s learning new skills or getting lost in the wilderness. Traveling is one of my greatest joys; so far, I’ve been to Kenya and Tamil Nadu, India, and I hope to see more of the world. Recently, I’ve set a personal goal to learn how to leverage Python and HTML for geospatial visualization and automation.
